## 🧩 CMS (Sanity) Setup

This repo includes a Sanity Studio in `frontend/serksa/` (created via `sanity init`) and the Next.js app reads content from Sanity with a **safe fallback** to local TypeScript content while you migrate.

### Environment variables (Next.js)

Set these in your environment (e.g. `frontend/.env.local`):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` (default used in code: `dwh5a0ih`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` (default: `production`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION` (default: `2025-01-01`)

### Run the Studio

```bash
cd frontend/serksa
npm run dev
```

### Run the Next.js frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Hosting
- **Vercel** - Free tier
- **Custom Domain** - Optional

### Cost
- **$0/month** - Completely free!
